# How To Run

To deploy this application the following steps in the order must be taken:

1- Build the server side application by "npm run server:build". This will create a production folder with the node files transpiled through babel.

2- Build the client side application with "npm run client:build". This will use webpack and babel to produce one output javascript file that will be put into the production folder created by the first step.
